# Tourism-NZ-Booking-App
Please note you need to provide your own Google Maps API key for this web app to function properly. For security reasons, I have not included my own API Key
as this is a public repository. You need to get one from Google and paste it over "key" in this line of code in the script.js file:

// ==========================================================
// MAPKEY
// ==========================================================
var script = '<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=' + key + '&callback=initMap&libraries=&v=weekly" defer></script>';
